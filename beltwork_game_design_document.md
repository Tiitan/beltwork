## A Cozy Automation & Trade Game in the Asteroid Belt

---

## 1. High Concept

**Beltwork** is a cozy, idle-friendly automation game set in the asteroid belt, inspired by hard science fiction but presented with cartoon-style, comforting visuals.

The player runs a growing industrial space station, harvesting resources from asteroids, processing them through factories, and selling or reinvesting the results. Progress continues while offline.

There is no combat, no punishment, and nothing to lose — only opportunities to improve efficiency, specialization, and influence within a shared economy.

## 2. Core Pillars

### 2.1 Cozy Hard-SF

- Realistic constraints (power, heat, logistics)
- Friendly visuals and readable UI
- Calm pacing, no sudden failures

### 2.2 Automation as Intent

- Players define priorities, not code
- Systems run themselves when the player is away
- Optimization is optional, not mandatory

### 2.3 Offline-Friendly Progress

- Continuous simulation
- Short play sessions encouraged
- Long-term planning rewarded

### 2.4 Multiplayer Without Pressure

- Shared markets and economy
- No real-time requirements
- NPCs fill the market (Mars and Moon) when players are scarce

## 3. Setting & Fiction

The game takes place in the asteroid belt, where independent operators maintain industrial stations supporting humanity’s outer expansion.

Your station is remote, fragile, and self-sustaining — one small node in a larger economic system. You are not a conqueror, but a caretaker, engineer, and organizer.

## 4. Core Game Loop

1. Scan for new asteroids
2. Deploy mining rigs to extract resources
3. Process materials through station factories
4. Assemble components
5. Decide: reinvest or sell on the open market

Players return to reports, stockpiles, market changes, and new opportunities.

## 5. Resources

### 5.1 Mining Rigs

Mining rigs are semi-autonomous industrial units deployed to asteroids. They combine extraction, first-pass processing, and transport into a single abstraction.

Mining rigs:

- Operate continuously while deployed
- Convert asteroid mass into usable resources
- Accumulate heat and wear over time

Advanced rigs unlock better efficiency, reduced waste, and improved autonomy.

### 5.2 Standardized raw Resources (MVP)

- **Water** – life support, fuel processing, cooling
- **Metals** – structural materials (iron, aluminium abstractions)
- **Conductors** – electrical and electronic materials (copper, gold abstraction)
- **Carbon Materials** – plastics, composites, chemicals

### 5.3 Asteroid Properties

Asteroids **properties** that influence mining output:

- Composition
- Distance
- Size

## 7. Station

### 7.1 Station Role

The station is the main screen of the game for the player. For the MVP it is represented as:

- a list of building levels
- an inventory (materials and components)
- state (energy, heat, crew mood)

### 7.3 Station buildings

each property is a level that can be upgraded individually, capped by the station level itself

- Fusion reactor - produce energy for all other buildings - consume water

- Storage - station inventory - level up: more space

- Life support - enable factories upgrade - consume water

- scanner and survey  - list asteroids, probe for composition - level up: rare asteroid

- Reffinery (factory) - convert materials into components - Level up: efficiency - consume energy

- Assembler (factory) - convert component into advanced components - level up: speed - consume energy

- Mining Docks - send mining operation - Level up: Increase the max mining rig and mining efficiency - consume energy for each active rig

- Trading hub - sell ressources on the market - level up: lower commission

- radiators - reduce the station heat overtime, when the station overheat the factories stop

## 9. Market & Economy

### 9.1 Open Market

The economy is shared across all players. NPC traders (Mars and Earth's Moon) provide baseline activity, and prices shift slowly over time. Player actions influence supply, demand, and long-term trends.

### 9.2 Selling vs Keeping

Selling provides currency, reputation, and market influence. Keeping resources enables station upgrades, specialization, and autonomy. There is no single optimal choice.

---

## 10. Multiplayer Design

### 10.1 No Direct PvP

- No combat
- No sabotage
- No loss caused by other players

### 10.2 Indirect Interaction

Players interact through shared markets, competing supply chains, infrastructure demand, market fluctuations, and leaderboards.

---

## 11. Progression

### 11.1 Parallel Tracks

**Station Capability** – scale, throughput, autonomy

**Automation Sophistication** – more rules, smarter prioritization

**Reputation & Identity** – known supplier, specialist producer, economic backbone

Stations feel unique over time.

---

## 12. Tone & Visual Style

- Cartoon proportions
- Soft colors
- Friendly UI
- Calm animations

Despite realistic constraints and hard-SF inspired systems, the game should feel safe, warm, and thoughtful.

---

## 13. Player Experience Goals

The player should feel calm, clever, and curious about long-term outcomes. A typical session lasts 5–15 minutes.

---

## 14. What Beltwork Is Not

- Not a combat game
- Not a clicker
- Not a real-time competitive MMO

---

## 15. One-Sentence Pitch

Beltwork is a cozy, idle-friendly space station game where you manage asteroid resources, and shape a shared economy at your own pace.
